Health Care Management ML Project Description:

This project uses machine learning to predict the health risk level of patients by analyzing components such as glucose level, BMI, diabetes status, blood pressure, and other medical indicators. By training predictive models on healthcare data, it helps in early identification of high-risk patients, allowing timely medical attention and lifestyle interventions.

The system includes a simple GUI for inputting patient data and displaying the predicted risk level, making it user-friendly for hospitals and clinics to use in daily operations. This project demonstrates how ML can support healthcare decisions and improve patient care by providing data-driven risk assessment.
